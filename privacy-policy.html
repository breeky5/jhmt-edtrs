                <h2>Privacy Policy — JHMT EDT Registration System</h2>
                <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 11, 2026</p>

                <h3>Who we are</h3>
                <p>The JHMT EDT Registration System is a Bank of Humanity (BOH) Educational Summits tool for JHMT official facilitators. It supports registration token requests, and integrates with BOH-approved services. It will evolve into a one-stop hub for BOH-JHMT activities.</p>

                <h3>What this app does</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Authenticates authorized JHMT facilitators using their session email</li>
                    <li>Manages EDT (Ecosystems Development Training) registrations and registration token-related requests</li>
                    <li>Generates a CSV file formatted to suit BOH-required data for certifications</li>
                    <li>Sends transactional emails (e.g., confirmations, updates)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Information we collect</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Session email address (to verify you are an authorized facilitator)</li>
                    <li>Registration details and token request information you submit</li>
                    <li>Operational logs for security/troubleshooting (non-sensitive metadata)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How we use your information</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>To authenticate and authorize access (facilitators only)</li>
                    <li>To process registrations and token requests</li>
                    <li>To help regional heads analyze reports for load replenishment purposes.</li>
                    <li>To send necessary transactional emails related to your activity</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Data storage and retention</h3>
                <p>Relevant data may be stored in JHMT-managed systems (including Google BigQuery). We do not sell your data. Data is retained as required for BOH-JHMT operations, compliance, and auditing, then deleted or anonymized per policy.</p>

                <h3>Data sharing</h3>
                <p>Data may be shared with BOH-approved systems strictly to operate the service (e.g., CocoonHub). We do not share data with third parties for advertising or marketing.</p>

                <h3>Permissions this app requests</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Send email (to deliver confirmations/notifications)</li>
                    <li>Your email address (to verify identity and enforce access)</li>
                    <li>External connections (to securely call CardanoScan services and Google APIs)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Security</h3>
                <p>We rely on Google's security (Apps Script, OAuth) controls. Access is restricted to authorized users. No system is 100% secure; please protect your account credentials.</p>

                <h3>Your choices</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>You may decline permissions; some features will not work without them.</li>
                    <li>You may request correction or deletion of registration data where applicable.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Children's data</h3>
                <p>This app is intended for authorized facilitators and not for children.</p>
